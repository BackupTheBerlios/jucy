   <title>Readme File for JAVA SOCKS Server</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>
New Features and Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Support for chaining proxies have been added. Now you can run this proxy
behind the firewall. It is now possible to connect through multiple proxies.
That is this proxy server can use another proxy to connect to another to
connect to another ... so on and only then to the required host.</li>

<li>
Some bugs have been fixed.</li>

<li>
This server now works with ICQ correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
How to run server</h2>
First go to the <tt>bin</tt> directory, and make changes to configuration
file <tt>socks.properties,</tt> there are plenty comments there to give
you some idea of what does what. Most important is to set <b><tt>range</tt></b>
and <b><tt>users</tt></b> attributes. Range controls what hosts are allowed
to use this proxy. And <b><tt>users</tt></b> attribute controls who is
allowed to connect from those host. Not setting <b><tt>users</tt></b> implies
that authentication will be done solely on the basis of the origin of the
connection. If however <b><tt>users</tt></b> attribute is set, authentication
will be based on the user name information which will be collected from
the Identd daemon, so proxy users will require to run Identd daemons on
their machines, in order to be granted permission to use proxy. Other attributes
control proxy behaviour like timeouts and have reasonable default values.
<br>It is possible to allow user A,B and C to connect from machine M1 and
users D and E to connect from machines M2 and M3, in order to achieve this
you will have to define two configuration files, first would contain all
initialisation data like port to listen on, timeouts to use and so on plus
it will contain lines
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt><font size=+0>range = M1</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=+0>users = A;B;C</font></tt></blockquote>
<font size=+0>Second file would contain just two lines + any comments</font>
<blockquote><tt><font size=+0>range = M2;M3</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=+0>users = D;E</font></tt></blockquote>
You will then specify these files on the command line for SOCKS server.
<p>Once configuration is complete you should edit batch file to make it
suitable for your machine, examples for UNIX and Windows machines are provided.
If you are on UNIX do not forget to do <b><tt>chmod</tt></b> on the SOCKS
file.
<h2>
SocksEcho</h2>
SocksEcho is another application which uses <tt>socks</tt> package. It
is GUI echo client, which is SOCKS aware, you can make and accept connections
through the proxy using this client. You can also send datagrams through
SOCKS5 proxy. See <tt>SocksEcho.bat</tt> or <tt>SocksEcho</tt> on how to
run it.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Requirements</h2>
In order to run these application you will need Java Virtual Machine which
supports Java 1.1 or higher. I have tested it with jdk1.1.6 and jdk1.2.2
under Windows95 and on jdk1.1.5 under Solaris. Server application might
be able to run even under java 1.0, but I haven't tested this.
