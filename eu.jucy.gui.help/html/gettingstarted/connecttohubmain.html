<h1>Connecting to a hub</h1>
Go to
<b>View -&gt; Public Hubs</b>  or just click the icon with 
the PC in the Toolbar.<p>

A list with hubs will load automatically. And you can right-click
on one and click on <b>Connect</b>.
Which will immediately open a Hub window where you can see all users
and communicate in the mainchat.<p>
If no hublist loads the selected hublist might be down.
Just select another hublist in the <b>Configured Public Hub List</b> box and 
click on <b> Load Hublist</b>. <p>

Add a hub to favourites if you want to connect to it in
future without the need to search for it in the hublist.<p>
