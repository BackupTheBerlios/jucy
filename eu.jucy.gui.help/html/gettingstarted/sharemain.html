<h1>What to share</h1>
First think about what you want to share.<p>

<h4>Good for sharing are</h4>
 - Movies<br>
 - Music<br>
 - Books<br>
 - All stuff you think as useful and harder to find over web. <p><p>
 
<h4>Bad for sharing (actually these things can get you kicked from hubs!)</h4>
 - Installations (Useless trash)<br>
 - Pornography (Many hubs allow underage users, <br>
   sharing porn with underaged is a severe crime therefore often a reason for a kick) <br>
 - Family pictures are very bad as they are something private. Also pictures of children <br>
   playing naked on the sandy beach are under some definitions child pornography, so be careful. <br>
 - Unfinished Files (nobody wants to download an unfinished download of some other p2p tool)<br>
 - National fascistic Music and stuff is usually not liked <br>
 - Things nobody is interested in and only bloat your share (i.e. only sharing HDTV 16GiB version <br>
   of "3 hours fishing with Rod" documentary)<p><p>
   
   

You should share as much as you can as many hubs require a minimum share 
to even connect (ranging usually from 1 GiB to 100 GiB).
Even if hubs don't require more, just share it, as high shares in combination with 
lively chatting are the best way to get you invited in private hubs that often have 
lots of interesting stuff. 
<p>
  
<h1>How to share something</h1>

Go to <p>
<b> File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Sharing </b> <p>

Click on <b>Add folder</b>  and choose a folder you want to share. 
Then you are asked to provide a name under which others see that directory. 
Either just leave the recommendation or give it a more meaningful name.
Repeat this until you share anything you want shared.<p>

When you click <b>OK</b> , UC will start hashing the files. That is mandatory work 
that needs to be done once so other users can search easier for these shared files, and 
it helps so files can be transferred without getting corrupted.<p>
