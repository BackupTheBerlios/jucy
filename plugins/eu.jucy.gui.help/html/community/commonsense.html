<h1>Common Sense</h1>
Its sometimes hard for someone new to know what is expected from oneself. Therefore this little introduction.

<h2>What do OPs expect from you? </h2>

Expectations from users have decreased over the years, while in early times of DC chatting was a real must. 
Today everyone is accepted that is willing to stick to the rules.
So the first task for you when connecting to a hub would be to find out what the hub's rules are.
Usually a summary is provided in the MOTD (Message of the Day). 
This is a text you usually receive first from the hub on connect. 
Its also useful even when being long time in a hub to scan the MOTD for changes, 
as often important messages (like hub will change its address or rule changes)  
will be put in MOTD so users that missed it can read it up. <p>

If you accept the rules stay in the hub. If not, well best would be to leave.
Common rules you could expect from every hub if not stated otherwise are: <br>
- No porn <br>
- No advertising  (Spamming other users with messages about how good that other hub is)<br>
- No fakeshare   (using a modified client that fakes a share, but does not really provide anything for others to download)<br>

<p>
Also an important unspoken rule is that a user should respond to questions OPs ask.
Its often hard for operators to keep an eye on the whole crowd so be happy about  
an OP having a problem with you, that tries talking first. Often OPs are accustomed 
to users not responding or expect users being offline and not in front of their PC. 
This results in an "First kick, ask later" attitude to 
get the attention of users. So don't be offended if a OP just kicks you with a 
message instead of first talking to you about your mistake. Its mainly a time 
thing not meant to be impolite. If you don't understand what the OP wanted to 
tell you with his message best is to just ask him on your next connect. <p> <p>
