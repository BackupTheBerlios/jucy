<h1>Community</h1>
The strength of DirectConnect is its community.
While other p2p systems draw their speed from newer and better algorithms for faster transfers. 
DC gets it by its community. Like having human operators that ban fakers. 
Also DC has private hubs that recruit people that have proven to be good users by sharing lots of good stuff, 
chatting or what ever those are interested in. <p>

Though because DC  is so community oriented. One should know some of the basics. 
Therefore here is given a little introduction on how to behave and on common habits in DC.<p>

- <a href="commonsense.html">Common sense in hubs</a>  <br> <!-- TODO DC spirit page -->
- <a href="rarsharing.html">Rar sharing / original releases</a><br>
- I got kicked/banned. What now? <br>
