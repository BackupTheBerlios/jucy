All classes in the de.du_hub.uc.helpers package are under Public Domain.
An exception is the package missing16api as this is sourcecode by sun copied 
from 1.6 java so jucy still works with 1.5 base.
Even though jucy itself is not I think this classes might be helpful to everyone.

Especially: TableViewerAdministrator  is a nice add-on to standard jface TableViewer.
IconManager is a good help for getting icons to files for swt applications.
