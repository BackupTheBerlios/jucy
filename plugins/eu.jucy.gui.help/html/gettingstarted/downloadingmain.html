<h1>Downloading Files</h1>

Now when you are in a hub just right click on a user and 
choose <b>Get FileList</b>. 
If you can see the FileList getting downloaded on the bottom 
in the Transfers view, then everything is ok. <p>
You can now either download files by choosing them from a 
downloaded FileList or by using the search. 


<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>


If download or search is not working you should first rule out
that the hub you are in allows you downloading/searching. 
Some hubs block these for new users and require them to register.
If this is the case the hub will usually send you a message that
you need to register.


<h4>Download</h4>

If the FileList is not downloaded usual reason is that you 
are behind a router/NAT. If that is the case you will need 
to forward a port to your PC. Forward TCP and UDP protocol on
the ports that are set under <br>
<b> File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Connection Settings </b> <br>
TCP is needed for file transfers, while UDP is used to receive 
search results.



<h4>Search</h4>
If search is not working but download does most probable reason
is that you did not forward the UDP port. So re-check your router's 
configuration. Though there is also the possibility that your firewall
blocks incoming UDP traffic. This was often a problem with old WinXP 
build in firewall. <p>

<h4>Fail-safe</h4>
If nothing helps and you can't get UC to download and search.
Then go to <br>
<b> File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Connection Settings </b> <br>
and check  <b>Use passive mode</b>. When this is checked 
downloading and searching should work. Though the negative
side is that you will get less search results. Also you can 
now only download from peers that are not in passive mode. <p>
