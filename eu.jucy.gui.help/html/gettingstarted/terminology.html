<h1>Terminology</h1>
Before we can start we need some bits of terminology/DC-slang so the 
following getting started guide gets shorter. <p>

DC/DirectConnect - the name of the p2p system jucy is made for. <p>

Hub - Hubs are servers where your clients connects to. They 
forward your searches to other clients.Also they help establishing   
connections to other clients so your downloads can start. 
And provide facility to chat in public (referred to as mainchat  
or just main) or in private (PM). <p>

OP - Hubs are guarded by OPs. These are other users with special state that  
may kick or ban users they seem unfit for their hub. You can 
distinguish them from normal user as they have a yellow key beside 
their user icon. <p>

Owner - The owner of a hub is usually the one hosting it. So he is 
the one that decides who is an OP in his hub. <p>

Mainchat - or main the place where all the chatting takes place. Also
a good place to ask any open questions you might have about DC.  <p>
