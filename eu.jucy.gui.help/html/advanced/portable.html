<h1>Portable jucy</h1>

Some people like to carry around their programs with an USB stick. So they can use them everywhere.
With jucy this not as easy as jucy stores all data in the user folder by default and not with the program.
But this this can be changed in the jucy.ini file.
This file has some basic parameters that change jucy's behaviour.
<p><p>
It should contain something like: <br>
-data
@user.home/UC
-vmargs
-Xmx256m
<p><p>

"-data @user.home/UC"  stands for using the UC subdirectory of the user's home directory. To make jucy use the program 
folder for storing userdata one can just delete the whole data parameter. Or for example if multiple users should use 
the same settings "@user.home/UC"  can be replaced with a path that all users can access. i.e. a shared Folder like 
"C:\Users\Public\UC" or "/some/place/.UC".  <p><p> 


<h3>Memory Settings</h3>
As a side note when we are at looking at the .ini-file: <br>
All after -vmargs  is arguments for the java virtual machine. There is currently only "-Xmx256m" which tells Java to 
allow jucy to use up to 256 MiB of Ram. Better don't change this. Fewer might result in errors, more would just be lost Ram.
