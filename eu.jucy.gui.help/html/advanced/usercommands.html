<h1>User Commands</h1>

Sometimes its useful specially for operators to add extra commands to your right-click menu.
i.e. having a command prepared that kicks some user for sharing pornography. Or bans a user for not sharing anything.

<p>
To do this go to  <br> File -> Preferences -> User Commands -> New <br>
You will be presented with a dialog that allows you to add items to your popup menus. <p>

Type: Allows you to choose if it is a command. Or choose Seperator if you want just a Seperator in the menu to seperate different kinds of commands.<p>
Context: Here you can choose in which popup menus the Items should appear. <br>
<PRE>
- Hub Menu			Appears if you click on the text in the hub.
- User Menu			The Menu on clicking on the userlist right 
				to the text.
- Search Menu			Appears clicking on search results in 
				the search window.
- FileList Menu			The Menu appearing on clicking a file 
				in the FileList 
</PRE> <p><p>
Parameter <br>

Name: The Name under which the Command should appear. With \ submenus can be created.
i.e. Kicks\Porn   for Porn entry in a submenu called "Kicks" <p>

Command: A command that will be sent to the hub on click.
i.e.:<p>
$To: %[userNI] From: %[myNI] $<%[myNI]> Hello %[userNI]!|
<p> will send a PM to the selected user saying Hello followed by the nick of the user.<p>
A lot of %[user/myXY]- jokers like %[userNI] or %[myNI] can be used to be replaced with context information. <br>
The "user" prefix is there for reference to the selected user, "my" prefix is used for self reference. 
These can be used from everywhere except the Hub Menu:
<PRE>
NI 			-	the Nick
I4			-	IP address
SS			-	The number of bytes Shared
SSshort			-	The number of bytes shared in better readable form.
VE			-	The client Version. (First part of the "Tag" 
				in the Userlist)
SL			-	The amount of Slots
EM			-	The Email address.
DE			-	Description
HN/HR/HO		-	Hubs normal/regged/op  reference to the number of
				hubs a user has. 
</PRE>
Additional for the FileList Menu and the Search Menu some more jokers can be used to reference a selected file. <br>
<PRE>
%[fileFN]		-	the filename
%[Directory]		-	the full path of the parent directory
%[filePath]		-	the full path of the file
%[fileSI]		-	file size
%[fileSIshort]		-	file size in readable format
%[fileTR]		-	TTH Root hash of the file
%[fileMN] 		- 	Magnetlink for the file
%[type]			-	either "File"  or "Directory" 
</PRE>
Always available is:
<PRE>
%[line:text]		-	i.e. %[line:What is the reason for the Kick?] will 
						open up a pop-up asking for input.
</PRE>

An example for usage with a hubsoft could be (here an example that works with Ynhub):<p>
<%[myNI]> !tbanick %[userNI] 120 %[line:Why?]|<%[myNI]> !tban %[userNI] 120 %[line:Why?]| 
<p>

Hub: can be used to restrict the command to be only shown in certain hubs. Empty for all hubs,
 "op" for all hubs where you are Operator or an address to specify a hub.<p>

Send once for each user: If this is marked the command will be sent multiple times once for each 
item selected in the Userlist/Search/Filelist. <p>
