      ADL Search allows one to search through the files and Folders of a downloaded Filelist. And let files that are interesting be sorted out automatically.

This is very helpful for OPs for example by sorting all files that contain &quot;porn&quot; or &quot;xxx&quot; into a folder called suspicious checking filelists becomes easier.
